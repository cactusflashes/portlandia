### Update Sept. 7th, 2023 8:26 p.m.
#### Homepage is about 75% to 80% complete at this stage. I need to polish some of the viewport scalability and positioning of child elements, but I am in a good spot now with the functionality. The real chore is going to be going back and procuring the data from past 3 years' projects and giving them a polish and shine. 

### Update Sept. 13th, 2023 7:16 p.m. 
#### Hitting a mental block with the portfolio project and am not sure where to jump back into the workflow. I think that I'm going to focus on the project information first before coming back to the page contents. 

### Update Sept. 17th, 2023 9:11 p.m.
####Made some good progress breaking through my mental block on my portfolio and making some strides with the responsive mobile version of my site. Still have to polish a few things around the edges but I'm feeling a lot better moving forward, and hope to have some project pages done soon, after I can put the proverbial pin in the homepage. 

### Update Sept. 20th, 2023 9:11 p.m.
#### Finished off a basic template page for project pages! The homepage is just about done, just a few additional touches for mobile, which I will most likely tackle this weekend. The next steps after that will most likely be to create the project pages with content, and then a /work page with all the projects as a gallery. I want to actually go ahead and set a deadline for myself on the first release of my official portfolio. I want to have the project deployed before the end of October. I'm hoping sooner than later, but after getting over the initial hump and mental block, I can feel the full development cycle begin to chug along. 


### Update October 4th, 2023
#### Actually finished a lot of small changes between updates. I have a better merge system and a better live dev environment to test changes now. I scrapped my mobile UI for now, but I am going to retackle that this upcoming weekend. I'm actually hoping to have a first complete prototype complete before next week. Cheers!  

### Update November 6th, 2023
#### I hit a pretty big block about 2 weeks ago and haven't committed any code since then. More stressors have come up in my life, and I am working on a soul project in the meantime with some Swift. Will be back before the end of the year to finish this off.  

### Update November 12th, 2023
#### Getting stale on another project for the time being so it was refreshing to hop back over here and work on some relaxing programming while not straining my brain lol. A few reconfigurations, but I will be rolling to prod hopefully before the end of the year.
