## ðŸ““ Third or fourth iteration design of my portfolio in the past year.

#### I've been working quietly on the newest design of my portfolio. I had different aspirations in the past for what I wanted, but I kept hitting a wall in the design phase, and I felt like each design didn't suite me well enough, or that I could've done better or flashier things. Ultimately, I decided to take a break from portfolio building and spend more time in my full-time duties. A few months later and some more projects under my belt I feel I am in a good place to pick this back up and endeavor at it again. I decided to not put too much pressure on myself this go-around and just tinker around in Svelte and see what I doodle up with. I'm going to post updates on this readme for future reference + case study to look back on. Until then, happy coding!

### Updates 
##### update Sept. 7th, 2023 8:26 p.m.
###### Homepage is about 75% to 80% complete at this stage. I need to polish some of the viewport scalability and positioning of child elements, but I am in a good spot now with the functionality. The real chore is going to be going back and procuring the data from past 3 years' projects and giving them a polish and shine.
