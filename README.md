#### I've been working quietly on the newest design of my portfolio. I had some different aspirations previously for what I wanted, but I kept hitting a wall in the design phase, and I felt like each design didn't suit me well enough, or that I could've done better or flashier things. Ultimately, I decided to take a break from portfolio building and spend more time on my full-time duties. A few months laterâ€”_and with some more projects under my belt_â€”I feel I am in a good place to stretch my legs and endeavor at this again. I decided to not put too much pressure on myself this go-around, and just tinker around in Svelte to see what I doodle up with. I'm going to post updates on this markdown for future reference & case study to look back on. Until then, happy coding!

## Updates 
##### Update Sept. 7th, 2023 8:26 p.m.
###### Homepage is about 75% to 80% complete at this stage. I need to polish some of the viewport scalability and positioning of child elements, but I am in a good spot now with the functionality. The real chore is going to be going back and procuring the data from past 3 years' projects and giving them a polish and shine. 

##### Update Sept. 13th, 2023 7:16 p.m. 
###### Hitting a mental block with the portfolio project and am not sure where to jump back into the workflow. I think that I'm going to focus on the project information first before coming back to the page contents. 

##### Update Sept. 17th, 2023 9:11 p.m.
###### Made some good progress breaking through my mental block on my portfolio and making some strides with the responsive mobile version of my site. Some mocks are included below.
